# Hangman-Game

This project is a hangman game that allows you to guess any letter while the allotted guesses remain. You can win or lose depending on if you correctly guess the letters in the number of chances remaining. If you guess a letter correctly, you do not lose a guess. 

This game is set up with multiple loops and functions to help narrow down the choices, the words, if they are correct, how to count wins/losses, and how to track letters used. 

You start the game by pressing any key. You guesses are recorded and any incorrect guess take aways a guess. Any correct guess populates the letter and does not count against you. If you guess the word correctly in the allotted guesses, you win. If not, you loose. The game repeats indefinitely, randomly cycling through a set of pre-determined words related to the theme. 

This can be run in a standard web browser. Contributions can be pushed to this github.
